or on behalf of such employee by way of tax for such years shall be payable by the employee in addition to any other tax for which he may be liable for the previous year in which the accumulated balance due to him becomes payable.</p><p style="font-family:Times New Roman; text-align:justify; margin:3pt; font-size:12pt; margin-bottom:4pt; margin-top:0pt;">(2) Where the accumulated balance due to an employee participating in a recognised provident fund which is not included in his total income under the provisions of rule 8 becomes payable, an amount equal to the aggregate of the amounts of

any tax which may have been paid on any sum, and such aggregate (if any) shall be deemed to be income received by the employee in the previous year in which the recognition of the fund takes effect
